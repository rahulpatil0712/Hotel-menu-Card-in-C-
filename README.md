Hi, I just started programming and I have this assignment and I want to do the advanced options but I have problems trying to do them.
This is the assignment.

• Each time the program runs it takes a single customer’s order.

• Print a welcome message that the user can read to the customer.

that item to the customer’s order.

• The menu is printed each time the user is ready to add a new item.
